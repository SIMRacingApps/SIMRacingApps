---                    Configuration Requirements                                                  ---
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page may install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit version is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation on how to find it.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. If a Firewall is running, you might get prompted to allow the server to run.
       Depending on if your Ethernet connection was made private or public, 
       you may be asked to confirm that also. Please select allow.
       If your Firewall doesn't prompt you, then you will have to add an exception to allow "java.exe"
       for both in-bound and out-bound traffic on all ports. 
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues for more information.
    4. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    5. To use the Electron client with the Apps/Widgets overlaid on top of the SIM, you 
       must have the SIM running in Windowed mode. Please see the following Wiki info to configure the SIM.
       https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-iRacing-in-Windowed-Mode
    6. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.

    2. When a session has limited laps and it is timed, 
       display the lesser of TimeRemaining and EstimatedTimeRemaining.

    3. Closed #154 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/154)

       Images will expand, but best to use aspect ratio of 1.6 or (800x480)
       Path: Documents/SIMRacingApps/CarNumbers/LeagueID-{leagueId}/{carNumber}.png

    5. Closed #153 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/153)
       REFERENCE car should follow who the camera has selected.
       Can be turned on/off in settings using (reference-camera = y/n)

    7. Updated Jetty Engine from 9.3.7 to 9.4.9 to get rid of Java 10 warnings.

    8. Fixed #159 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/159)
       Electron: When Apps become visible, a hidden task bar will unhide and stay there.
       This occurred when using the new visible feature as well as "show all" command
       from Voice Attack. This hides the apps from the task bar. 
       If you don't have this problem and you wish to see them on the task bar,
       add this to your settings to turn it back on.
           electron-showappsontaskbar = Y
           
    9. Created a CameraSelectorVertical30 which shows the CarSelector widget on the bottom.

    12. Fixed the Speedometer value on the other cars.
           
    13. Closed #163 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/163)
        Lotus79 & 49 Fuel not showing in Imperial Gallons
        
    14. New PlugIn to use LIFX Lights for the Flags. http://lifx.com.

        Thanks to Gary Whitson for providing me with a unit to test with.
        
    15. Added option to auto start your browser on the SIMRacingApps menu
        if you are not going to be auto starting Electron.
        I added it to the default settings to be true for new users.
        Existing users will have to add the following to their settings.
           browser-autostart = Y

       The widget display averages for 5,10,15,20,30,40 laps
       
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/Lap/AVERAGE/(LAPSTOAVERAGE)
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/Lap/AVERAGESINCEPITTING/(LAPSTOAVERAGE)
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/Lap/RUNNINGAVERAGE/(LAPSTOAVERAGE)
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/Lap/RUNNINGAVERAGESINCEPITTING/(LAPSTOAVERAGE)
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/LapTime/AVERAGE/(LAPSTOAVERAGE)
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/LapTime/AVERAGESINCEPITTING/(LAPSTOAVERAGE)
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/LapTime/RUNNINGAVERAGE/(LAPSTOAVERAGE)
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/LapTime/RUNNINGAVERAGESINCEPITTING/(LAPSTOAVERAGE)

    20. Closed #166 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/166)
        Towing: Time Left Available June 2018 from iRacing
        The Car's Status will also show TOWING, thus not counting that time for being in your Pit Stall.

    21. Fixed issue where sometimes it thinks you were resetting the car when 
        stopping in your pit and taking less than full service.

    22. Fixed #171 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/171)

        Changed from weight to volume.
        
    24. Fixed issue where the Endurance config at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps
        was not working in the Track Map widget.

        where the 3rd row was not correct.

    26. Closed #174 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/174)

        Port not shown in window title when port 80 is in use.
        
    29. Fixed issue mapping TeamSpeak Nicknames to Driver Names when they have been mapped in the settings.
        Now you can put a users TeamSpeak nickname in the settings and map it to their iRacing name.
        This will allow the radio transmitting indicators to work when they key up in TeamSpeak.
        Consider my TeamSpeak name is "Jeff Gilliam", then map it this way to my iRacing Name.
        If users append or prepend a car number, I remove that before comparing. So, do not include in the mapping.
           Jeff\ Gilliam = Jeffrey Gilliam
    
    30. Fixed where the start/finish was on some of the Nurburgring configurations in the TrackMap.

    32. Fixed #172 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/172)
        TimingDelta widget not correct in team events
        Fixed issue where the TimingDelta widget did not correctly calculate your session best lap time
        when you are in a team session and the fastest lap was not set by you.

    1. Closed #122 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/122)
       CarLeft, CarRight: Show when car(s) are to the left or right of you
       Added 2 new widgets, CarLeft and CarRight.
       These are simply arrows that follow the spotter indicators. 
       There are 2 sets of them, so you can place 2 lefts in different places.
       Use the transparent feature of Electron, to hide them when they're not showing.

    2. Added new API call to get the spotter messages.
           /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/SpotterMessage
       Can return the following
          - (blank) = not talking
          - CLEAR = no cars around you
          - CARLEFT = car to your left
          - CARRIGHT = car to your right
          - CARLEFTRIGHT = car on your left and right

       You can turn this on in the settings with "teamspeak-update-name = Y".
       It is off by default because it doesn't work in a team or when spotting,
       because it changes it to the driver's name in those sessions.

    14. Fixed #136 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/136)
        VoiceAttack, Start Gear Announcement, setting SRA_loop false still loops.
        Change to use local variables.
        The preferred way to disable a spotter loop, is to remove it from the "Start Spotter" command
       
    15. Fixed #141 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/141)
        Invalid Characters in the UserName causes server to crash
        This fixes Brian Wertman's and Don Runkle Jr.'s issues where SRA would only crash on Sunday nights.
        Turns out, the league he runs on Sunday, the admins were putting invalid characters in the UserName.

    16. Closed #101 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/101)
        Add option to all widgets to autohide
        Electron was enhanced to allow users to select when an app/widget should be visible.
        Options are when: NotConnected, InCar, InGarage, InReplay
        These options are saved with your configuration.

    18. Closed #138 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/138)
        Electron: Ability to click through the transparent areas
        What this means is if you need to move or resize an Electron widget, 
        you will need to turn off transparency, move/resize, then turn it back on.
        You can disable this feature by adding "electron-noclickthrough=y" to the settings.

    19. Added RadioTransmitting Widget. Contributed by Ricky Thompson.
    
    20. Fixed issue where empty folders in the Documents\SIMRacingApps\favorites, apps, widgets
        would prevent any user defined files from loading. 
        
    21. Closed #143 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/143)
        Camera Selector support 30 cameras

    22. Updated JNA library from 4.2.1 to 4.5.1.

    23. Wrote my own YAML parser and retired the SnakeYaml parser.
        Did this to stop chasing iRacing's bad YAML output. 
        This one is very forgiving.

        approximation of laps remaining and/or the time remaining.

    26. Closed #148 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/148) 
        Server: Remap Driver Names
        Simply add the name to change in the settings with SIM name on the left.
        Any spaces on the left side must have a backslash in front of the space.
        Use this to highlight friends, enemies, blacklist, whatever
          Jeffrey\ Gilliam = *[Jeff Gilliam] 
          John\ Doe27 = >>John Doe
          Young\ Gun = !!Danger Danger

        If first one is in use, it will try the next and so on.
        You can still change the first port it tries in the settings.
        If your port is busy, then 8080 and 5555 will be tried.
    
    31. Added ability to edit useroverrides.css to the menu
    
    32. Added 2 new widgets for the non-purists, 
        AnalogGauge/Spek/Speedomter and BarGauge/Speedometer

    1. Fixed #98 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/98)
       Team Driver Swap PitCommander issue
       When changing drivers, this issue could have caused the pit service to stop adding
       fuel or not change tires remaining tires if the swap occurred before the service was completed.
    
    2. Fixed #108 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/108)
       PitCommands: Changes tires when you drop onto pit road
       
    3. Fixed #123 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/123)
       Server crashes when camera pack uses invalid characters for YMAL in the name

    4. Fixed #125 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/125)
       WeatherInfo Widget text not sized to window

       StandingsBanner widget doesn't display laps down correctly

    6. Fixed #127 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/127)
       Electron: Error when "documents" is on OneDrive
       Error: EINVAL: invalid argument, lstat 'C:\Users\{user}\OneDrive'

    7. Added option for the pit count down to stop at.

    9. In the new version of Electron, they fixed a bug that I was relying on as a feature.
       To get the blue bar to pop up at the top of each widget, I was catching the mouse events.
       They are no long sending those events because they consider that area the window title area.
       You can still grab in that area and move the widget and you can right click to close it.
       Therefore, for now, I'm going to put this release out without the bar. 

1.4_Build_2017.10.22
    1. Fixed #103 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/103)

       I added quotes before the YAML is parsed.

    7. Voice Attack was sending the "You're Welcome" message to the wrong car.
       It should send it to the car in front of you.

       - Added a command for the leader of your class "Leader Class"
       - Changed Ahead/Behind and Class commands to be by position instead of relative.
         This way when a lap down it will talk about the cars you're competing with.
         The old commands are still there, just renamed to "Ahead/Behind Relative".
         
    3. Fixed #94 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/94)
       iRacing Replay missing some telemetry values. 
       Now takes Position, LapCompleted from replay.
       Please note that there are many values missing from the replay
       or they are the session ending values and will not change.

           shift-replay = false 

    2. Closed #71 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/71)
       Data Publisher Plugin: Send data to external server.
       See link to issue for specific details.
       To have you data published to your league's web site,
       you must know your league's id for the SIM and the URL to the server.
       Your league admin will provide you with this information.
       You can enter as many leagues as you want in the settings.txt file
       and any time you are in one of these league's session, 
       it will start transmitting your data.
       A leagueId of "0" will publish all non-league sessions, even hosted.
 
       By default, this is turned off. Enable it with these settings in your settings.txt file. 
       The default interval is 5000 milliseconds, change that by adding
       The URL must be set to your league's web site address that is setup to receive this data. 
       
          DataPublisher-Post = Y
          DataPublisher-Post-Interval-{leagueId} = 10000
          DataPublisher-Post-URL-{leagueId} = http://{YourLeaguesWebSite}/{pathToData}

           /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/(GAUGE)/Count
           /Session/Id
           /Session/LeagueId

       The URL is now broadcasted on port 28888.
       There is a sample client posted to GitHub at (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingAppsURLClientTest)
    
    13. Fixed #82 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/82)
       settings.txt - simplugins variable needs to ignore trailing spaces

    14. Fixed #85 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/85)
       Yield was spell wrong in the Voice Attack Profile

       Anyone wishing to translate into other languages, please post a message to SIMRacingApps on FaceBook.

    20. Added the Bullring track in Las Vegas from the March 2017 build.

    23. Fixed #96 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/96)
       TeamSpeak 3.1.3 or later added a security key to be able to access the client remotely.
       
            teamspeak-apikey = your key

       You can find your key in TeamSpeak -> Options -> Addons -> Plugins -> ClientQuery -> Settings
       and either update or add an entry to the settings.txt file.

    24. Added Dirt profiles for new Cars and Tracks from the iRacing 3/29/2017 build.

       and Pit Controller apps for the Sprint Cars.

1.1_Build_2016.09.15
       
    1. Fixed #53 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/53) where SRA would not pick the 
       latest version of Java if the version number of Java was greater than 99. 
       Oracle released versions 101 and 102 recently.
       This only affects you if you have multiple version of Java installed at the same time.
       You can also just uninstall the older version of Java.
       
    2. Fixed #54 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/54) Pit Count Down plugin to not play when you
       first enter the session. Also, not to play anything if it doesn't know where the pit stall is.
       It was counting down to the start/finish line.
       
    3. Closed #48 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/48) by Adding new Pit Speed Limit 
       plugin to beep when you are speeding on pit road.
       To disable this plugin, add "!Sounds.PitSpeedLimit" to the list of simplugins in the settings.txt.
       The following variables can be put in your settings.txt file to customize it. 
       
       These are the defaults.
           a. pit-speed-limit-device = {name of your sound device if not your default} 
           b. pit-speed-limit-volume = 1
           c. pit-speed-limit-beep-rate = 300
           d. pit-speed-limit-beep-rate-excessive = 200
           e. pit-speed-limit-clip = com/SIMRacingApps/SIMPluginCallbacks/Sounds/Clips/speeding_beep.wav
           
    4. Closed #59 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/59)
       Broadcaster, CarSelector, TrackMap: Option to change the camera to the selected car.
       
    5. Closed #60 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/60)
       TrackMap: Add number of cautions and laps to track info box
       
    6. I added a Voice Attack Profile to the release downloads.
       This profile does not use keystrokes to control the SIM, it instead sends the commands directly
       to the SIMRacingApps Server ReST ATI. Not only is this more robust, but the same commands will work with
       any SIM supported by SIMRacingApps. Please feel free to download and modify the phrases to your own preferences.
       You will need the registered version of Voice Attack ($10) to be able to import this profile.
       For more information on Voice Attack, see (http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/How-to-use-Voice-Attack).
       
       Here is the full list of the commands (and aliases):
       
       1.  Add Fuel: Tops off the Fuel on the next pit
       2.  Add Splash Of Fuel(Add Splash): Add just enough fuel to finish the race
       3.  Ahead: Say who is ahead of you in your class
       4.  Behind: Say who is behind you in your class

       7.  Change Right Sides(Change Rights, Right Sides, Two Tires): Change Right Side Tires Only
       8.  Fast Repair: Checks the Fast Repair box if you have any left.
       9.  Fuel Level: Say your fuel level and how much you need to finish.
       10. Full Service: Change all 4 tires and top off with fuel and tearoff
       11. Incidents: Say how many incidents you have and the limit.
       12. Lap Time: Say what your last lap time was
       13. Laps In Tank(Fuel Laps, Laps Until Pit): Say how many laps you can go on fuel
       14. Laps To Go: Say how many laps to go for the leader
       15. Leader: Say who the leader is and how far ahead they are
       16. No Fast Repair: Unchecks the Fast Repair Box.

       25. Start Spotter: Start the Spotter Tasks
       26. Stop Spotter: Stop the Spotter tasks
              
    7. Closed #61 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/61)
       WaitingForSIM: Show a splash screen when SIM is not connected.
       When the SIM connects, it hides itself.
       You can provide your own image by saving a PNG file called 
       "WaitingForSIM.png" in your "Documents/SIMRacingApps" folder.
       The image will scale using an aspect ratio of 16x9.
       Useful for streamers to put on top of their stream when they are not in a session.
       Remember to add the "&BACKGROUNDCOLOR=transparent" parameter to the URL.

    8. Closed #64 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/64) by Adding new Sounds.Shift 
       plugin to beep when you need to shift.
       To disable this plugin, add "!Sounds.Shift" to the list of simplugins in the settings.txt.
       The following variables can be put in your settings.txt file to customize it. 
       
       These are the defaults.
           a. shift-device = {name of your sound device if not your default} 
           b. shift-volume = 1
           c. shift-clip = com/SIMRacingApps/SIMPluginCallbacks/Sounds/Clips/shift_beep.wav
           
    9. Removed support for Satellite views on the TrackMap. MapQuest changed their licensing such that
       you cannot cache any of their data. To connect to it real-time, you must get a license key.
       I don't think it's worth getting the real-time key, because some of the tracks do not exist anymore
       and I'm not allowed to use the static image, because that requires caching it.
       I will leave the legacy map images out there, but they will be no longer be accessible from the menu.
       I will continue to support the Open Street Map views.
       
    10. Added support for iRacing's new track, Circuit des 24 Heures du Mans.
    
    11. Added support for iRacing's new car, Audi 90 GTO.
       
1.0_Build_2016.07.07
    1. This is the initial release of the SIMRacingApp's Suite.
    2. As a first release, I only have it working with 1 SIM, iRacing.
       Other SIM plug-ins will be developed at a future date.
    3. Also, full International support is built in, but there are no translations as of yet. 
       So, I'm looking for volunteers to translate the text to other languages.
    4. BETA testing has been occurring over the last 9 months and I feel like the software is very stable.
       But, nothing is perfect. Please use the issues list at http://issues.SIMRacingApps.com, to report
