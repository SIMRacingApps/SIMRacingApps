         These cars now report brake pressure bias in the garage which matches with the dcBrakeBias value in telemetry.
         This does not match the In Car Black Box, though. Not sure what iRacing is trying to do. Will wait and see.
       - Changed the InGarage widget to use the new variable, IsGarageVisible that's in the telemetry.
         It is faster and works even if you're not driving in a team event (according to the iRacing release notes).

    6. Added 2 new API calls get and set the restart method.
       - /Session/Restart

    8. Fixed Brake Bias Issue with the new Late Model Stock car.
       Thanks to Jacob Elliott for reporting this.
       
    9. Enhanced the Race Administrator app by changing the admin commands to use the driver's name instead of their number.
       iRacing made some changes for teams that changed how the numbers work. 
       I also added support for the commands to be changed in the settings.
       In the commands below, the variables in brackets [] will be substituted. Here are the supported variables.
            - [TEXT] = All text sent to the chat window, including admin commands.
            - {ENTER} = Replaced with the Enter key.
            - [DRIVER] = The driver's car number, for legacy support.
            - [NUMBER] = The driver's car number.
            - [DRIVERNAME] = The driver's name with spaces replaced with dots.
            - [TIME] = The number of minutes or laps depending on the command.
            = [NAME] = The name of the Radio Channel.
       
       Here are all the commands you can add in the settings with their default values.
       Just copy/paste them to the top of the settings and restart SRA.
       Refer to iRacing's help at https://support.iracing.com/support/solutions/articles/31000133518-session-admin-chat-commands
       
        iracing-sendkeys-CHAT-ALL = [TEXT]{ENTER}
        iracing-sendkeys-CHAT-DRIVER = /[DRIVERNAME] [TEXT]
        
        iracing-sendkeys-ADMIN_COMMANDS-ADMIN = !admin [DRIVERNAME]
        iracing-sendkeys-ADMIN_COMMANDS-ADVANCE = !advance
        iracing-sendkeys-ADMIN_COMMANDS-BLACK = !black [DRIVERNAME] [TIME]

        iracing-sendkeys-ADMIN_COMMANDS-PITCLOSE = !pitclose
        iracing-sendkeys-ADMIN_COMMANDS-PITOPEN = !pitopen
        iracing-sendkeys-ADMIN_COMMANDS-PACELAPS = !pacelaps [LAPS]
        iracing-sendkeys-ADMIN_COMMANDS-RESTART = !restart [METHOD]
        
        iracing-sendkeys-RADIO_COMMANDS-ADD = @add [NAME]
        iracing-sendkeys-RADIO_COMMANDS-REMOVE = @remove [NAME]
        iracing-sendkeys-RADIO_COMMANDS-TRANSMIT = @transmit [NAME]
        iracing-sendkeys-RADIO_COMMANDS-MUTE = @mute [NAME]
        iracing-sendkeys-RADIO_COMMANDS-UNMUTE = @unmute [NAME]
        iracing-sendkeys-RADIO_COMMANDS-SCAN = @scan
        iracing-sendkeys-RADIO_COMMANDS-NOSCAN = @noscan
       
1.19_Build_2022.10.04
    1. Fixed issue with Replay option in Electron Menu.
    
1.19_Build_2022.09.18
    1. Added new configuration for Bristol Dirt 2022.
    
    2. Fixed issue where the "hideCarNum" variable was moved from the app.ini to the rendererDX11.ini file.
       It defaults to the Monitor file. But if you use VR, you can add this variable with the file of choice to the settings.
          iracing-renderer-file = rendererDX11Monitor.ini

    3. New content from iRacing's June 2022 and Oct 2022 builds and patches thus far.
       - Mercedes-AMG GT3 2020
       - Mercedes-AMG GT4
       - Radical SR10
       - Sandown International Motor Raceway
       - Fuji International Speedway
       - Port Royal Speedway
       - Atlanta New Scan
       - Indianapolis Motor Speedway Road Course
       - Porsche Mission R
       - Lucas Oil Speedway - Dirt Oval
       - Motorsport Arena Oschersleben - Road Course (4 configs)
       - Rudskogen Motorsenter - Road Course
       - Indianapolis Motor Speedway - IndyCar Oval 2022 Laser Scan Update
       - Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (992) Shiftlamp RPM range has been adjusted.

    4. Because iRacing added an option to disable their Pit Count Down, 
       I'm re-enabling SRA's Pit Count Down if the option in iRacing has been turned off.
       After making the change in iRacing, exit iRacing to update the app.ini and restart SRA.
       Make sure to turn on SRA, update/add the following to the settings.
         pit-count-down-enabled = Y
         
    5. Fixed issue with the car's bearing calculation where some tracks where correct and others not.
       Changed the Track/Bearing and Car/{REFERENCECAR}/Bearing API to normalize the bearing where north is 270 degrees like all other API calls.
       This also required a change to the WindGauge widget.
    
    6. Added an option to the Car/{REFERENCECAR}/Bearing API to use the YawNorth telemetry value instead of the track based bearing.
       Here is the new setting and it defaults to Y.
         bearing-uses-actual-yaw = Y

    7. In the RaceAdministrator app, added code to close the pits before the stages end.
       To enable this you will have to download the 
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingAppsWebContent/master/apps/RaceAdministrator/default.js 
       file and save it in the Documents/SIMRacingApps/apps/RaceAdministrator folder. 
       Then before each session modify the variables around line 260 to suite your needs.
       New API, /Session/IsPitRoadOpen was created to support this feature.

    8. Added new widget called Pit Road Lights
    
    9. Closed #173 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/173)
       Added red dots on the TrackMap and also made displaying them an option controlled with the parameter, SHOWSECTORS.
       Streamers need to add "&SHOWSECTORS=Y" to the end of the TrackMap URL to enable them. They are off by default.
       Added these new API methods
       - /Track/Sectors/(SECTORTYPE)/(UOM)
       - /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/Sector

    10. Close #264 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/264)
        Added new widget called SIMState to show the SIM's State (OFF, REPLAY, LIVE)
        Thanks to Ricky Thompson for this suggestion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---                    Configuration Requirements                                                  ---
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page may install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit version is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation on how to find it.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. If a Firewall is running, you might get prompted to allow the server to run.
       Depending on if your Ethernet connection was made private or public, 
       you may be asked to confirm that also. Please select allow.
       If your Firewall doesn't prompt you, then you will have to add an exception to allow "java.exe"
       for both in-bound and out-bound traffic on all ports. 
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues for more information.
    4. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    5. To use the Electron client with the Apps/Widgets overlaid on top of the SIM, you 
       must have the SIM running in Windowed mode. Please see the following Wiki info to configure the SIM.
       https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-iRacing-in-Windowed-Mode
    6. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.
    
    Issues:
        Please visit the issues list at http://issues.SIMRacingApps.com to see if an issue you are have 
        has already been reported. This list also contains enhancement requests.
        You will need to create a GitHub account to post a new issue or subscribe to an existing issue. 
        But, that is the easiest way to keep track of it and follow conversations on the issue.
        
    Wiki:
        There is a Wiki for SIMRacingApps at http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com.
        Here you can find solutions, work-around, etc.
       
****************** Previous Versions *************************

1.18_Build_2022.03.20
    1. Added ability to override car profile values in the settings.
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-{Gear}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-{Gear}-{PowerLevel}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-States-{StateName}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-{Gear}-States-{StateName}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-{Gear}-{PowerLevel}-States-{StateName}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - See Wiki at https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-override-car-profile-gauge-values-in-settings

    2. Added new content from iRacing's Dec 2021, Jan 2022, March 2022 builds.
       - Honda Civic Type R
       - Hyundai Elantra N TC
       - Mercedes-AMG F1 W12 E Performance
       - Knockhill Racing Circuit
       - Watkins Glen International (Fully re-scanned and re-built for 2021)
       - Hockenheimring Baden-Wurttemberg - 4 New Track Configurations for the Porsche Experience Center
       - LA Coliseum.
       - Aston Martin Vantage GT4
       - Hyundai Veloster N TC
       - iRacing Formula iR-04
       - NASCAR Buick LeSabre - 1987
       - Stock Car Pro Series Toyota Corolla
       - Stock Car Pro Series Chevrolet Cruze
       - Federated Auto Parts Raceway at I-55
       - Winton Motor Raceway
         
    3. Fixed VIR East/West Trackmap
       - When you load East, iRacing reports it as West and vice verser.
         So I made the track map match no matter the name.

    4. Fixed issue with NASCAR Next Gen where the Chevrolet and Toyota logos were wrong.

    5. Added new setting "fuel-level-needed-buffer-laps" to allow users to defined how many laps to add to the full needed calculation. Default is 1 lap.
       fuel-level-needed-buffer-laps = 1
       
    6. Added option to Electron scripts to allow it to run with newer versions of Electron for testing purposes.

    7. Corrected issue with Silverstone GP Layout and Pit Road.
    
    8. Fixed issue with Brake Bias on NASCAR Next Gen 2022 where the telemetry did not match the black box display in game.
       This fix has the side affect, that cars that do not display the percentage found in the setup, will.
       For example, the NASCAR Trucks would only display the delta change -3 to 3%. It now applies that change to the setup value.
       If you want to display the raw telemetry value, you can turn this off by adding this setting and override that setting by car.
       - Brake-Bias-Correction = N
       - Brake-Bias-Correction-{CARNAME} = Y
       
    9. Added logic to Electron to move any apps/widget that are off screen to the primary monitor.
       You will have to move them back to where you want them.
       This is the number 1 issue that I get questions on.
       This most often occurs after a Windows update, or switch resolutions while SRA is running.

    10. Disabled the Pit Count Down by default, but left the pit position calls enabled.
        You can disable the iRacing spotter or set it to "Low" and control SRA it with these settings.
        * pit-count-down-enabled = Y
        * pit-count-down-pit-position-enabled = Y

1.17_Build_2021.10.28
    1. Added Phoenix 2021 Raceway from iRacing's Oct-2021 build.

1.17_Build_2021.09.26

    1. Fixed #249 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/249)
       CameraSelector Names Overlapped

    2. Fixed #245 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/245)
       Gauges do not work in AI Session or when ghosting watching.
       
    3. Figured out all the wheel types and colors.
       So, now your painted wheel types and colors will be shown on the CarImage widget.
       NOTE: Brushed and Glossy rims will not show, even in iRacing, unless session is launched from the new UI.
       
    4. Added new NASCAR Next Gen 2022 cars.
       NOTE: I'm seeing the voltage and brake bias in the telemetry is not matching the SIM display.

    5. Fixed Steering Wheel position. It was off by 6 degrees.
       
    6. Added Content from iRacing's June-Sept 2021 build and subsequent patches.
       - Formula Vee
       - VW Beetle Lite

       - Porsche 911 GT3 R
       - Red Bull Ring
       - Nashville Superspeedway
       - Chicago Street Circuit
       - Mount Washington Auto Road (This required some changes to the Track Map calculations)
       - Ferrari 488 GT3 Evo 2020
       - Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (992)
       - Hickory Motor Speedway
       - Hungaroring Circuit
       
    7. Fixed an issue with Chrome Browser and the Trackmap black boxes.
       They changed the default width behavior.

    8. Moved the SIMRacingApps/electron-apps folder to the %LOCALAPPDATA% folder.
       You may remove the Documents/SIMRacingApps/electron-apps folder.
       This can be changed by specifying the path in the settings with this variable, showing the default path.
       - electron-apps = %LOCALAPPDATA%/SIMRacingApps/electron-apps
       
    9. Added option to have the server continue running when Electron exits.
       To enable this, add this to your settings. This is the default setting.
       - electron-kills-server = Y
       
    10. Added missing club names
        - Japan
        - Mexico

    11. Added Pit Open/Closed buttons to the RaceAdministrator App
        - Implemented Pull Request #2 from Cody Moore
        - Also added Add/Subtract Caution Laps and One to Green.
       
    12. Fixed issue where trailing spaces in the settings were not trimmed off.
    
    13. Fix spelling error with the "reserved-cores" setting. No longer needs the one with the space in it.
    

1.16_Build_2021.04.20

    1. Added more robust parsing logic for sound devices.
    
    2. Added code to Electron to help with the Stay On Top logic with versions of Electron later than 5.x.
    
    3. Added option to start Electron minimized. Add the following to your settings.
       electron-startminimized = Y
       
    4. Implemented PitSvTireCompound from the previous iRacing's 2021 Season 1 Patch 3.
       Now you can see the Tire Compound you have selected to be put on during the next pit stop.

    5. In an attempt to fix stuttering issues in iRacing, SRA now reserves 2 cores by default for the iRacing to use.
       If the iRacing ever needs more cores, and you have enough to reserve more, add the following to your settings.
       A value of zero(0) will not reserve any cores.
       Example of reserving 3 cores:
          reserved-cores = 3

    6. Fixed issue when the users Documents folder was blank in the registry, to fall back to the default value.
       This was causing a Null Value Exception on some systems upon startup.
       
    7. iRacing added the ability to render your custom paints to a PNG file.
       I updated the CarImage widget to use it if available.
       It also checks the Documents\iRacing\app.ini[Graphics]hideCarNum setting.

    8. Added new content from iRacing's March 2021 Build and Hotfixes.
        - A new pace car, Sedan
        - A new Road Car, the McLaren 570s GT4, is now available!

        - A new Dirt Oval track configuration, Dirt, has been added to Bristol Motor Speedway!
        - A new Dirt Road track configuration, Rallycross, has been added to Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya!
        - A new Road track, Hockenheimring Baden-Wurttemberg, is now available!
        - A new Road track configuration, IndyCar 2012-2018, has been added to Sonoma Raceway!
        
    9. Added new widgets to compliment the new CarImage widget
       - CarImageExtended = that shows driver name
       - CarSelectorImages = to select cars when watching or broadcasting.
       - CarSelectorImages64 = to select cars when watching or broadcasting.
       
    10. Added code to try and bring iRacing Process to the foreground before sending 
        keystrokes to it. The name of the process it looks for is "iRacing.com Simulator".
        This can be changed with the following variable in the settings.
            iracing-title = iRacing.com Simulator

    11. Fixed #246 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/246)
        Shift Overrides in settings are not working

1.15_Build_2020.12.28

    1. Closed #237 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/237)

    4. Added iRacing's Superspeedway Track from the December 2020 Patch 1 release.
       It's not a real track, but iRacing has mapped the GPS coordinates to a real location that 
       will not make since if displayed in the TrackMap. So, the background has been grayed out.

1.14_Build_2020.10.01

    1. Fixed bug that would sometimes cause the main thread to restart.
    
    2. Fixed issue where your Best and Last lap times would not display if your country's number format contained a comma.
    
    3. Fixed an issue where the links on the menu were not correct of you tried to override the language.

    4. Closed #231 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/231)
       Added 'drive through' penalty in Race Administrator App
       Replaced the 1 Lap Black flag with Drive Through.

    5. Fix issue with the Dallara IR 18 where it would cause the shift light to 
       blink at the wrong time.

1.13_Build_2020.06.16

    1. Fixed RadioControl widget. It would not change channels.
       iRacing seems to have a bug, where you cannot select the @DRIVERS channel from chat.
       @TRANSMIT @DRIVERS
       Does not work 

    2. Fixed #188 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/188) 
       LapDelta widget not always in sync with final time posted by iRacing
       iRacing was calculating this based on your last clean best lap.
       I was using the best lap on the Lap Timing box, which doesn't care if it's clean.
       This was only a problem if your best lap wasn't clean.

    3. Added new Incidents widget.
    
    4. Added ability to select the Pace Car Camera in the CameraSelector Widgets.

    5. Closed #209 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/209)
       Add Real-time iRating to Standing Widget
       Changed iRating to be dynamically calculated as the positions change throughout the race.
       This only applies to single class races. I have not figured out how multi-class races are calculated.
       To turn this feature off and display the iRating the driver started the race with
       add this to the settings.txt.
           dynamic-irating = N
           
       New API to get the change in the iRating. /Car/REFERENCE/DriverRatingDelta
    
    6. Created new widget called DriverRating
    
    7. Went back to version 5.0.13 of Electron as that version was reported as working in some VR environments.
       Please send me your feedback. To try other versions see instructions here.
       https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-the-Electron-client

    9. Added North Wilkesboro Speedway Track Profile   
    
    10. Fixed the "What's the Weather" command in Voice Attack to say the SIM Time of Day
        - Voice Attack profile version 2020.05.16   
        - New API /Session/TimeString   
       
    11. Added more information in Voice Attack 2020.05.16 when pitting.
        Now says what tires and fuel you are asking for upon approaching the pits and when issuing the "Pitting In" command. 
        Also says your stall number based on your qualifying position.  
        
    12. In the Browser Menu, added the link to the widget to make it easier for streamers to get the links.
    
    13. Removed the Delayed Green message. iRacing re-purposed this flag to mean restart pending.

        This will allow for each Heat Race session to have a name.

    16. Closed #226 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/226)
        LIFX lights need option for Green to stay on while under green
        To turn this off add this to your settings:

1.8_Build_BETA-2019.01.26

    1. Fix an issue with the FuelTank, TirePressure widgets, and the Voice Attack "Add Splash" command.
       The wrong value was being sent to the SIM when the unit of measure defined for the car
       was different from your "Metric" setting in iRacing. 
       For example: If the car is the Ferrari 488 (which is liters) and your Metric setting is not checked in iRacing.
       
    2. Added support for SIMTime to be multiplied by a factor.
       Currently, iRacing doesn't log the multiplier in the telemetry that the session is using.
       Until they do, you can set the following variable in your settings each time
       you get into a session that is using a multiplier.
       {value} should be the integer portion of what iRacing is displaying.
       iRacing displays 1x, 2x, 4x, etc. but you should enter 1, 2, or 4.
       
          simtime-multiplier = {value}

1.8_Build_BETA-2019.01.19

    1. Copied electron.exe to SIMRacingApps-electron.exe and Updated Electron to 4.0.0 from 2.0.7.
       When checking if Electron is already running, other applications that use electron
       would give false positives. Renamed it to avoid conflicts.
       If you are not using the packaged version of electron,
       simply copy electron.exe to SIMRacingApps-electron.exe and restart the server.
       
    2. Fixed issues with TrackMap at COTA (Circuit of the Americas).
       Finish Line in wrong place (Grand Prix,West)
       Pit Road not mapped correctly (East).

       - Starter
       - ThrottleShape
       - TractionControl
       - TractionControlFront
       - TractionControlRear
       - WeightJackerRight

    6. Added new widget SIMTime, to display the virtual SIM time of the session.
       Also modified all Apps/Widgets that currently displays time, to display the SIMTime.
       Also added new API call, /Session/Time, that returns that time in UTC
       Also added new API call, /Track/TimeZone, to get the time zone for the current track.
       With this 2 new API calls, the client can display the time in the track's time zone.
       
    7. Added new track, Chili Bowl, from iRacing's 12/18/2018 release. 

1.7_Build_2018.09.26

       was not rotating the bottom half.

    1. Now providing a "signed" Server exe for testing in the wild.
       Please download and try it out and send me pictures of prompts
       that anti-virus software says about it.
       It is not linked to a certified authority, but it should prevent tampering with the exe.
       
    2. When a session has limited laps and it is timed, 
       display the lesser of TimeRemaining and EstimatedTimeRemaining.

    3. Closed #154 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/154)

       CarNumber: Add ability for user to provide PNG file
       Images will expand, but best to use aspect ratio of 1.6 or (800x480)
       Path: Documents/SIMRacingApps/CarNumbers/LeagueID-{leagueId}/{carNumber}.png

    5. Closed #153 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/153)
       REFERENCE car should follow who the camera has selected.
       Can be turned on/off in settings using (reference-camera = y/n)                                   
       
    6. Added widgets for displaying the SRA logo so streamers can show SRA some love.
       SRALogo, SRALogoURL
       
    7. Updated Jetty Engine from 9.3.7 to 9.4.9 to get rid of Java 10 warnings.

    8. Fixed #159 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/159)
       Electron: When Apps become visible, a hidden task bar will unhide and stay there.
       This occurred when using the new visible feature as well as "show all" command
       from Voice Attack. This hides the apps from the task bar. 
       If you don't have this problem and you wish to see them on the task bar,
       add this to your settings to turn it back on.
           electron-showappsontaskbar = Y
           
    9. Created a CameraSelectorVertical30 which shows the CarSelector widget on the bottom.

    11. On the Main Menu, disabled the "Upload" button until a file was chosen.
        Thanks to Steve Kubay for reporting this. It was putting you in a place you could not back out of.
        
    12. Fixed the Speedometer value on the other cars.
           
    13. Closed #163 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/163)
        Lotus79 & 49 Fuel not showing in Imperial Gallons

        Thanks to Gary Whitson for providing me with a unit to test with.
        
    15. Added option to auto start your browser on the SIMRacingApps menu
        if you are not going to be auto starting Electron.
        I added it to the default settings to be true for new users.

        - Subaru WRX STI
        - Detroit Grand Prix at Belle Isle
        
    20. Closed #166 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/166)
        Towing: Time Left Available June 2018 from iRacing
        The Car's Status will also show TOWING, thus not counting that time for being in your Pit Stall.

    21. Fixed issue where sometimes it thinks you were resetting the car when 
        stopping in your pit and taking less than full service.

    22. Fixed #171 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/171)
        Fuel Widgets - Incorrect fuel units on Porsche 919
        Changed from weight to volume.
        
    24. Fixed issue where the Endurance config at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps
        was not working in the Track Map widget.
     
    25. Fixed issue with the CarSelector64 and the Apps/Widgets that use it,
        where the 3rd row was not correct.

    29. Fixed issue mapping TeamSpeak Nicknames to Driver Names when they have been mapped in the settings.
        Now you can put a users TeamSpeak nickname in the settings and map it to their iRacing name.
        This will allow the radio transmitting indicators to work when they key up in TeamSpeak.
        Consider my TeamSpeak name is "Jeff Gilliam", then map it this way to my iRacing Name.
        If users append or prepend a car number, I remove that before comparing. So, do not include in the mapping.
           Jeff\ Gilliam = Jeffrey Gilliam
    
    30. Fixed where the start/finish was on some of the Nurburgring configurations in the TrackMap.

    1. Closed #122 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/122)
       CarLeft, CarRight: Show when car(s) are to the left or right of you
       Added 2 new widgets, CarLeft and CarRight.
       These are simply arrows that follow the spotter indicators. 
       There are 2 sets of them, so you can place 2 lefts in different places.
       Use the transparent feature of Electron, to hide them when they're not showing.

    2. Added new API call to get the spotter messages.
           /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/SpotterMessage
       Can return the following
          - (blank) = not talking
          - CLEAR = no cars around you
          - CARLEFT = car to your left
          - CARRIGHT = car to your right
          - CARLEFTRIGHT = car on your left and right

       You can turn this on in the settings with "teamspeak-update-name = Y".
       It is off by default because it doesn't work in a team or when spotting,
       because it changes it to the driver's name in those sessions.

        Closed #140 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/140)

    14. Fixed #136 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/136)
        VoiceAttack, Start Gear Announcement, setting SRA_loop false still loops.
        Change to use local variables.
        The preferred way to disable a spotter loop, is to remove it from the "Start Spotter" command
       
    15. Fixed #141 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/141)
        Invalid Characters in the UserName causes server to crash
        This fixes Brian Wertman's and Don Runkle Jr.'s issues where SRA would only crash on Sunday nights.
        Turns out, the league he runs on Sunday, the admins were putting invalid characters in the UserName.

    16. Closed #101 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/101)
        Add option to all widgets to autohide
        Electron was enhanced to allow users to select when an app/widget should be visible.
        Options are when: NotConnected, InCar, InGarage, InReplay
        These options are saved with your configuration.
        Electron also automatically reloads the App/Widget if you change Transparent or Frame.
        Electron does not allow transparent and frame to be selected at the same time.
    
    17. Fixed favorites to allow https URLs.
        
    18. Closed #138 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/138)
        Electron: Ability to click through the transparent areas
        What this means is if you need to move or resize an Electron widget, 
        you will need to turn off transparency, move/resize, then turn it back on.
        You can disable this feature by adding "electron-noclickthrough=y" to the settings.

    19. Added RadioTransmitting Widget. Contributed by Ricky Thompson.
    
    20. Fixed issue where empty folders in the Documents\SIMRacingApps\favorites, apps, widgets
        would prevent any user defined files from loading.

    22. Updated JNA library from 4.2.1 to 4.5.1.

    23. Wrote my own YAML parser and retired the SnakeYaml parser.
        Did this to stop chasing iRacing's bad YAML output.

        Server: Remap Driver Names
        Simply add the name to change in the settings with SIM name on the left.
        Any spaces on the left side must have a backslash in front of the space.
        Use this to highlight friends, enemies, blacklist, whatever
          Jeffrey\ Gilliam = *[Jeff Gilliam]

        You can still change the first port it tries in the settings.
        If your port is busy, then 8080 and 5555 will be tried.
    
    31. Added ability to edit useroverrides.css to the menu
    
    32. Added 2 new widgets for the non-purists, 
        AnalogGauge/Spek/Speedomter and BarGauge/Speedometer

       Team Driver Swap PitCommander issue
       When changing drivers, this issue could have caused the pit service to stop adding
       fuel or not change tires remaining tires if the swap occurred before the service was completed.
    
    2. Fixed #108 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/108)
       PitCommands: Changes tires when you drop onto pit road

       StandingsBanner widget doesn't display laps down correctly

    9. In the new version of Electron, they fixed a bug that I was relying on as a feature.
       To get the blue bar to pop up at the top of each widget, I was catching the mouse events.
       They are no long sending those events because they consider that area the window title area.
       You can still grab in that area and move the widget and you can right click to close it.
       Therefore, for now, I'm going to put this release out without the bar. 

1.4_Build_2017.10.22
    1. Fixed #103 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/103)

       iRacing: The CameraInfo.GroupName is not quoted and can contain invalid characters
       I added quotes before the YAML is parsed.

    7. Voice Attack was sending the "You're Welcome" message to the wrong car.
       It should send it to the car in front of you.

    8. Fixed #110 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/110)
       TrackMap: SPA Endurance Config has finish line in wrong place

       Electron Client is now bundled with the Server. 
       To have the apps stay on top of iRacing, you will need to enable "Windowed" mode.

       The following entries in Documents/SIMRacingApps/settings.txt need to exist to enable it.

       - Added a command for the leader of your class "Leader Class"
       - Changed Ahead/Behind and Class commands to be by position instead of relative.

         The old commands are still there, just renamed to "Ahead/Behind Relative".
         
    3. Fixed #94 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/94)
       iRacing Replay missing some telemetry values. 
       Now takes Position, LapCompleted from replay.
       Please note that there are many values missing from the replay
       or they are the session ending values and will not change.

       Data Publisher Plugin: Send data to external server.
       See link to issue for specific details.
       To have you data published to your league's web site,
       you must know your league's id for the SIM and the URL to the server.
       Your league admin will provide you with this information.
       You can enter as many leagues as you want in the settings.txt file
       and any time you are in one of these league's session, 
       it will start transmitting your data.
       A leagueId of "0" will publish all non-league sessions, even hosted.
 
       By default, this is turned off. Enable it with these settings in your settings.txt file. 
       The default interval is 5000 milliseconds, change that by adding
       The URL must be set to your league's web site address that is setup to receive this data.

       and Pit Controller apps for the Sprint Cars.

1.1_Build_2016.09.15
       
    1. Fixed #53 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/53) where SRA would not pick the 
       latest version of Java if the version number of Java was greater than 99. 
       Oracle released versions 101 and 102 recently.
       This only affects you if you have multiple version of Java installed at the same time.
       You can also just uninstall the older version of Java.
       
    2. Fixed #54 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/54) Pit Count Down plugin to not play when you
       first enter the session. Also, not to play anything if it doesn't know where the pit stall is.
       It was counting down to the start/finish line.
       
    3. Closed #48 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/48) by Adding new Pit Speed Limit 
       plugin to beep when you are speeding on pit road.
       To disable this plugin, add "!Sounds.PitSpeedLimit" to the list of simplugins in the settings.txt.
       The following variables can be put in your settings.txt file to customize it. 
       
       These are the defaults.
           a. pit-speed-limit-device = {name of your sound device if not your default} 
           b. pit-speed-limit-volume = 1
           c. pit-speed-limit-beep-rate = 300
           d. pit-speed-limit-beep-rate-excessive = 200
           e. pit-speed-limit-clip = com/SIMRacingApps/SIMPluginCallbacks/Sounds/Clips/speeding_beep.wav
           
    4. Closed #59 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/59)
       Broadcaster, CarSelector, TrackMap: Option to change the camera to the selected car.
       
    5. Closed #60 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/60)
       TrackMap: Add number of cautions and laps to track info box
       
    6. I added a Voice Attack Profile to the release downloads.
       This profile does not use keystrokes to control the SIM, it instead sends the commands directly
       to the SIMRacingApps Server ReST ATI. Not only is this more robust, but the same commands will work with
       any SIM supported by SIMRacingApps. Please feel free to download and modify the phrases to your own preferences.
       You will need the registered version of Voice Attack ($10) to be able to import this profile.
       For more information on Voice Attack, see (http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/How-to-use-Voice-Attack).
       
       Here is the full list of the commands (and aliases):
       
       1.  Add Fuel: Tops off the Fuel on the next pit
       2.  Add Splash Of Fuel(Add Splash): Add just enough fuel to finish the race
       3.  Ahead: Say who is ahead of you in your class
       4.  Behind: Say who is behind you in your class

       7.  Change Right Sides(Change Rights, Right Sides, Two Tires): Change Right Side Tires Only
       8.  Fast Repair: Checks the Fast Repair box if you have any left.
       9.  Fuel Level: Say your fuel level and how much you need to finish.
       10. Full Service: Change all 4 tires and top off with fuel and tearoff
       11. Incidents: Say how many incidents you have and the limit.
       12. Lap Time: Say what your last lap time was
       13. Laps In Tank(Fuel Laps, Laps Until Pit): Say how many laps you can go on fuel
       14. Laps To Go: Say how many laps to go for the leader
       15. Leader: Say who the leader is and how far ahead they are
       16. No Fast Repair: Unchecks the Fast Repair Box.

       25. Start Spotter: Start the Spotter Tasks
       26. Stop Spotter: Stop the Spotter tasks
              
    7. Closed #61 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/61)
       WaitingForSIM: Show a splash screen when SIM is not connected.
       When the SIM connects, it hides itself.
       You can provide your own image by saving a PNG file called 
       "WaitingForSIM.png" in your "Documents/SIMRacingApps" folder.
       The image will scale using an aspect ratio of 16x9.
       Useful for streamers to put on top of their stream when they are not in a session.
       Remember to add the "&BACKGROUNDCOLOR=transparent" parameter to the URL.

    8. Closed #64 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/64) by Adding new Sounds.Shift 
       plugin to beep when you need to shift.
       To disable this plugin, add "!Sounds.Shift" to the list of simplugins in the settings.txt.
       The following variables can be put in your settings.txt file to customize it. 
       
       These are the defaults.
           a. shift-device = {name of your sound device if not your default} 
           b. shift-volume = 1
           c. shift-clip = com/SIMRacingApps/SIMPluginCallbacks/Sounds/Clips/shift_beep.wav
           
    9. Removed support for Satellite views on the TrackMap. MapQuest changed their licensing such that
       you cannot cache any of their data. To connect to it real-time, you must get a license key.
       I don't think it's worth getting the real-time key, because some of the tracks do not exist anymore
       and I'm not allowed to use the static image, because that requires caching it.
       I will leave the legacy map images out there, but they will be no longer be accessible from the menu.
       I will continue to support the Open Street Map views.
       
    10. Added support for iRacing's new track, Circuit des 24 Heures du Mans.
    
    11. Added support for iRacing's new car, Audi 90 GTO.
       
1.0_Build_2016.07.07
    1. This is the initial release of the SIMRacingApp's Suite.
    2. As a first release, I only have it working with 1 SIM, iRacing.
       Other SIM plug-ins will be developed at a future date.
    3. Also, full International support is built in, but there are no translations as of yet. 
       So, I'm looking for volunteers to translate the text to other languages.
    4. BETA testing has been occurring over the last 9 months and I feel like the software is very stable.
       But, nothing is perfect. Please use the issues list at http://issues.SIMRacingApps.com, to report
       any problems. You will have to create a GitHub account to do so.
    5. If you just have some questions, please join the SIMRacingApps group on FaceBook and post your
       question there. It can be found at http://facebook.com/groups/SIMRacingApps.
