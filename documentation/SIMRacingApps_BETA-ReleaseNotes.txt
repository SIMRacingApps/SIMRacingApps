    1. In the Browser Menu, added the link to the widget to make it easier for streamers to get the links.

    4. Added new API /Session/Name and used it in several apps were it was using /Session/Type
       This will allow for each Heat Race session to have a name.

    5. Closed #226 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/226)
       LIFX lights need option for Green to stay on while under green
       To turn this off add this to your settings:
       - LIFX-always-green = N
       
    6. Fixed issue where the Fast Repair would turn off if you sent any pit commands after you set it.

1.13_Build_BETA-2020.05.17

    1. Fixed the "What's the Weather" command in Voice Attack to say the SIM Time of Day
       - Voice Attack profile version 2020.05.16
       - New API /Session/TimeString
       
    2. Added more information in Voice Attack 2020.05.16 when pitting.
       Now says what tires and fuel you are asking for upon approaching the pits and when issuing the "Pitting In" command.   
       Also says your stall number based on your qualifying position.  

1.13_Build_BETA-2020.05.12

    1. New API to get the change in the iRating. /Car/REFERENCE/DriverRatingDelta

    1. Fixed Eastern Europe Club Name
    
    2. Closed #209 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/209)
       Add Real-time iRating to Standing Widget
       Changed iRating to be dynamically calculated as the positions change throughout the race.
       This only applies to single class races. I have not figured out how multiclass races are calculated.
       To turn this feature off and display the iRating the driver started the race with
       add this to the settings.txt.
           dynamic-irating = N
    
    3. Created new widget called DriverRating
    
    4. Added option to only count full laps since pitting.
       NOTE: it also doesn't count your in/out laps.
       It is off by default. To turn it on add the following to the settings.
       - laps-since-pitting-valid-only = Y
    
    5. Went back to version 5.0.13 of Electron as that version was reported as working in some VR environments.
       Please send me your feedback. To try other versions see instructions here.
       https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-the-Electron-client

1.13_Build_BETA-2020.04.07

    1. Fixed #218 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/218)
       Car # Sim Not Connected
       - this was introduced in 1.13_Build_BETA-2020.04.07
       
    2. Added ability to select the Pace Car Camera in the CameraSelector Widgets.

1.13_Build_BETA-2020.04.07

    1. Fixed RadioControl widget. It would not change channels.
       iRacing seems to have a bug, where you cannot select the @DRIVERS channel from chat.
       @TRANSMIT @DRIVERS
       Does not work
       
    2. Fixed #188 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/188) 
       LapDelta widget not always in sync with final time posted by iRacing
       iRacing was calculating this based on your last clean best lap.
       I was using the best lap on the Lap Timing box, which doesn't care if it's clean.
       This was only a problem if your best lap wasn't clean.
       
    3. Added new Incidents widget.

    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page may install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit version is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation on how to find it.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. If a Firewall is running, you might get prompted to allow the server to run.
       Depending on if your Ethernet connection was made private or public, 
       you may be asked to confirm that also. Please select allow.
       If your Firewall doesn't prompt you, then you will have to add an exception to allow "java.exe"
       for both in-bound and out-bound traffic on all ports. 
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues for more information.
    4. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    5. To use the Electron client with the Apps/Widgets overlaid on top of the SIM, you 
       must have the SIM running in Windowed mode. Please see the following Wiki info to configure the SIM.
       https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-iRacing-in-Windowed-Mode
    6. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.
