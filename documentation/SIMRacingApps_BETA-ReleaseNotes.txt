Version: 1.16_Build_BETA-2021.03.13

    1. Fixed issue when the users Documents folder was blank in the registry, to fall back to the default value.
       This was causing a Null Value Exception on some systems upon startup.
       
    2. iRacing added the ability to render your custom paints to a PNG file.
       I updated the CarImage widget to use it if available.
       
    3. Added new content from iRacing's March 2021 Build and Hotfixes.
        - A new pace car, Sedan
        - A new Road Car, the McLaren 570s GT4, is now available!
        - (Ford GT GT2) - Up-shift RPM lights have been updated to better match the engine power curve.
        - The Super Late Model has been re-built, using the latest 2021 NASCAR model!
        - Bark River International Raceway
        - A new Dirt Oval track configuration, Dirt, has been added to Bristol Motor Speedway!
        - A new Dirt Road track configuration, Rallycross, has been added to Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya!
        - A new Road track, Hockenheimring Baden-Wurttemberg, is now available!
        - A new Road track configuration, IndyCar 2012-2018, has been added to Sonoma Raceway!

1.16_Build_BETA-2021.02.09

    1. In an attempt to fix stuttering issues in iRacing, SRA now reserves 2 cores by default for the iRacing to use.
       If the iRacing ever needs more cores, and you have enough to reserve more, add the following to your settings.
       A value of zero(0) will not reserve any cores.
       Example of reserving 3 cores:
          reserved-cores = 3

1.16_Build_BETA-2021.01.23

    1. Added more robust parsing logic for sound devices.
    
    2. Added /SIMPluginCallback/DataPublisher/Post/Results API for widgets to get access to the server results.
    
    3. Added code to Electron to help with the Stay On Top logic with versions of Electron later than 5.x.
       I've been testing with Electron 10.3.0 and it seems to be working fine.
       I'm still bundling version 5.x, but if you want to try any of the new versions to see if it helps with VR,
       you can get instructions here, https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-the-Electron-client#different-version-of-electron.
    
    4. Added option to start Electron minimized. Add the following to your settings.
       electron-startminimized = Y
       
    5. Implemented PitSvTireCompound from the previous iRacing's 2021 Season 1 Patch 3.
       Now you can see the Tire Compound you have selected to be put on during the next pit stop.

    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page may install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit version is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation on how to find it.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. If a Firewall is running, you might get prompted to allow the server to run.
       Depending on if your Ethernet connection was made private or public, 
       you may be asked to confirm that also. Please select allow.
       If your Firewall doesn't prompt you, then you will have to add an exception to allow "java.exe"
       for both in-bound and out-bound traffic on all ports. 
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues for more information.
    4. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    5. To use the Electron client with the Apps/Widgets overlaid on top of the SIM, you 
       must have the SIM running in Windowed mode. Please see the following Wiki info to configure the SIM.
       https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-iRacing-in-Windowed-Mode
    6. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.
