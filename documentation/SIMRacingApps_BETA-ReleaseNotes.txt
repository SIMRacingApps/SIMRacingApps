    2. Implemented new content from iRacing's Dec 2019 build.
       - Lernerville Speedway
       - Lime Rock
       - Supercars Ford Mustang GT
       - Supercars Holden ZB Commodore
       - Fast Repairs Available now on the Pit Commander
       - There is now a drive through penalty in some series when you exceed the x17 incident limit.
         But, the telemetry is still reporting the DQ limit, which will be higher.
       
    3. Fixed Track Map for Nurbugring Tourist layout.
       Changed the definition of the finish line to be at 100%, not 0%.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page may install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit version is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation on how to find it.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. If a Firewall is running, you might get prompted to allow the server to run.
       Depending on if your Ethernet connection was made private or public, 
       you may be asked to confirm that also. Please select allow.
       If your Firewall doesn't prompt you, then you will have to add an exception to allow "java.exe"
       for both in-bound and out-bound traffic on all ports. 
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues for more information.
    4. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    5. To use the Electron client with the Apps/Widgets overlaid on top of the SIM, you 
       must have the SIM running in Windowed mode. Please see the following Wiki info to configure the SIM.
       https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-iRacing-in-Windowed-Mode
    6. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.

        There are many other recommendations on the SIMRacingApps Wiki at http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com.

1.12_Build_BETA-2019.10.26

    1. Fixed #211 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/211)
       Added a blue dot to the Trackmap to indicate where the merge point is for the REFERENCE car.
       Implemented new API calls for version 1.12
       - Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/MergePointLatitude
       - Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/MergePointLongitude
       NOTE: I will be evaluating the location of all the merge points to match the blue cone in iRacing.
             For now, they may be wrong or even non existent.
       
    2. Added new name for Charlotte 2019 ROVAL configuration that came out in iRacing's Oct 2019 patch.
    
    3. Updated Electron from version 4.0.0 to 6.0.12.
