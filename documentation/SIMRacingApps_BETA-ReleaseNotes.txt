---------------------------
For a complete list of issues completed in this version goto 
(https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/milestone/19)
and click on either open or closed. Be sure to look at the date closed
and download the BETA released after that date.

Version: 1.18_Build_BETA-2022.03.10
    1. Added LA Coliseum from iRacing's Jan 2022 build.
    
    2. Fixed issue with Brake Bias on NASCAR Next Gen 2022 where the telemetry did not match the black box display in game.
       This fix has the side affect, that cars that do not display the percentage found in the setup, will.
       For example, the NASCAR Trucks would only display the delta change -3 to 3%. It now applies that change to the setup value.
       If you want to display the raw telemetry value, you can turn this off by adding this setting and override that setting by car.
       - Brake-Bias-Correction = N
       - Brake-Bias-Correction-{CARNAME} = Y
       
    3. Added logic to Electron to move any apps/widget that are off screen to the primary monitor.
       You will have to move them back to where you want them.
       This is the number 1 issue that I get questions on.
       This most often occurs after a Windows update, or switch resolutions while SRA is running.

    4. Added content from iRacing's March 2022 build
       - Aston Martin Vantage GT4 (amvantagegt4)
       - Hyundai Veloster N TC (hyundaivelostern)
       - iRacing Formula iR-04 (formulair04)
       - NASCAR Buick LeSabre - 1987 (stockcars_buicklesabre87)
       - Stock Car Pro Series Toyota Corolla (stockcarbrasil_corolla)
       - Stock Car Pro Series Chevrolet Cruze (stockcarbrasil_cruze)
       - Federated Auto Parts Raceway at I-55
       - Winton Motor Raceway (national,club)
       
    5. Disabled the Pit Count Down by default, but left the pit position calls enabled.
       You can disable the iRacing spotter or set it to "Low" and control SRA it with these settings.
       * pit-count-down-enabled = Y
       * pit-count-down-pit-position-enabled = Y
       
    
1.18_Build_BETA-2021.12.31
    1. Added new setting "fuel-level-needed-buffer-laps" to allow users to defined how many laps to add to the full needed calculation. Default is 1 lap.
       fuel-level-needed-buffer-laps = 1
       
    2. Added option to Electron scripts to allow it to run with newer versions of Electron for testing purposes.
    
    3. Corrected issue with Silverstone GP Layout and Pit Road.
       
1.18_Build_BETA-2021.12.19
    1. Fixed issue with NASCAR Next Gen where the Chevrolet and Toyota logos were wrong.

1.18_Build_BETA-2021.12.13
    1. Added ability to override car profile values in the settings.
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-{Gear}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-{Gear}-{PowerLevel}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-States-{StateName}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-{Gear}-States-{StateName}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - {Car}-{Gauge}-{Track}-{Gear}-{PowerLevel}-States-{StateName}-{Attribute} = {value}
       - See Wiki at https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-override-car-profile-gauge-values-in-settings

    2. Added new content from iRacing's Dec 2021 build.
       - Honda Civic Type R
       - Hyundai Elantra N TC
       - Mercedes-AMG F1 W12 E Performance
       - Knockhill Racing Circuit
       - Watkins Glen International (Fully re-scanned and re-built for 2021)
       - Hockenheimring Baden-Wurttemberg - 4 New Track Configurations for the Porsche Experience Center
       
    3. Fixed VIR East/West Trackmap
       - When you load East, iRacing reports it as West and vice verser.
         So I made the track map match no matter the name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page may install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit version is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation on how to find it.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. If a Firewall is running, you might get prompted to allow the server to run.
       Depending on if your Ethernet connection was made private or public, 
       you may be asked to confirm that also. Please select allow.
       If your Firewall doesn't prompt you, then you will have to add an exception to allow "java.exe"
       for both in-bound and out-bound traffic on all ports. 
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues for more information.
    4. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    5. To use the Electron client with the Apps/Widgets overlaid on top of the SIM, you 
       must have the SIM running in Windowed mode. Please see the following Wiki info to configure the SIM.
       https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-iRacing-in-Windowed-Mode
    6. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.
