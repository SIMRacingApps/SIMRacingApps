## 1.19_Build_BETA-2022.08.16
    1. Close #264 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/264)
       Added new widget called SIMState to show the SIM's State (OFF, REPLAY, LIVE)
       Thanks to Ricky Thompson for this suggestion.
       
## 1.19_Build_BETA-2022.08.03
    1. New content from iRacing's July Patch
       - Indianapolis Motor Speedway Road Course
       
    2. In the RaceAdministrator app, added code to close the pits before the stages end.
       To enable this you will have to download the 
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingAppsWebContent/master/apps/RaceAdministrator/default.js 
       file and save it in the Documents/SIMRacingApps/apps/RaceAdministrator folder. 
       Then before each session modify the variables around line 260 to suite your needs.
       New API, /Session/IsPitRoadOpen was created to support this feature.
       
    3. Added new widget called Pit Road Lights
    
    4. Close #173 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/173)
       Added red dots on the TrackMap and also made displaying them an option controlled with the parameter, SHOWSECTORS.
       Streamers need to add "&SHOWSECTORS=Y" to the end of the TrackMap URL to enable them. They are off by default.
       Added these new API methods
       - /Track/Sectors/(SECTORTYPE)/(UOM)
       - /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/Sector

## 1.19_Build_BETA-2022.07.12
    1. New content from iRacing's June 2022 build and patches.
       - Mercedes-AMG GT3 2020
       - Mercedes-AMG GT4
       - Radical SR10
       - Sandown International Motor Raceway
       - Fuji International Speedway
       - Port Royal Speedway
       - Atlanta New Scan

    2. Because iRacing added an option to disable their Pit Count Down, 
       I'm re-enabling SRA's Pit Count Down if the option in iRacing has been turned off.
       After making the change in iRacing, exit iRacing to update the app.ini and restart SRA.
       Make sure to turn on SRA, update/add the following to the settings.
       pit-count-down-enabled = Y
     
    3. Fixed issue with the car's bearing calculation where some tracks where correct and others not.
       Changed the Track/Bearing and Car/{REFERENCECAR}/Bearing API to normalize the bearing where north is 270 degrees like all other API calls.
       This also required a change to the WindGauge widget.

    4. Added an option to the Car/{REFERENCECAR}/Bearing API to use the YawNorth telemetry value instead of the track based bearing.
       Here is the new setting and it defaults to Y.
         bearing-uses-actual-yaw = Y
   
## 1.19_Build_BETA-2022.05.22
    1. Added new configuration for Bristol Dirt 2022.
    
    2. Fixed issue where the "hideCarNum" variable was moved from the app.ini to the rendererDX11.ini file.
       It defaults to the Monitor file. But if you use VR, you can add this variable with the file of choice to the settings.
       * iracing-renderer-file = rendererDX11Monitor.ini

    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page may install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit version is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation on how to find it.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. If a Firewall is running, you might get prompted to allow the server to run.
       Depending on if your Ethernet connection was made private or public, 
       you may be asked to confirm that also. Please select allow.
       If your Firewall doesn't prompt you, then you will have to add an exception to allow "java.exe"
       for both in-bound and out-bound traffic on all ports. 
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues for more information.
    4. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    5. To use the Electron client with the Apps/Widgets overlaid on top of the SIM, you 
       must have the SIM running in Windowed mode. Please see the following Wiki info to configure the SIM.
       https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-iRacing-in-Windowed-Mode
    6. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.
