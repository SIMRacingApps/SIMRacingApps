Version: 1.20_Build_BETA-2023.03.14
    1. New widget called ABSActive
       - New API for gauges /Car/{REFERENCECAR}/Gauge/ABSActive

       ReplayControl - change >>>>> to say LIVE
       
    3. Closed #266 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/266)
       Camera names with slash in their name do not work
       Fixed issue with CameraControl widget when camera names had special characters in them.

    4. New content from iRacing's March 2023 build and patches to date of this version.
       - Late Model Stock is replacing the existing iRacing Late Model vehicle, the Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS.
       - Ray FF1600
       - Renault Clio R.S. V
       - Circuito de Jerez - Angel Nieto (2 configs Grand Prix, and Moto)
       - NASCAR Cup Series Next Gen Cars
         Engine rev limiters have been reduced.
         Shift light RPM have been updated.
         These cars now report brake pressure bias in the garage which matches with the dcBrakeBias value in telemetry.
         This does not match the In Car Black Box, though. Not sure what iRacing is trying to do. Will wait and see.
       - Changed the InGarage widget to use the new variable, IsGarageVisible that's in the telemetry.
         It is faster and works even if you're not driving in a team event (according to the iRacing release notes).
       - NASCAR Cup Series Gen 4 Chevrolet

    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page may install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit version is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation on how to find it.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. If a Firewall is running, you might get prompted to allow the server to run.
       Depending on if your Ethernet connection was made private or public, 
       you may be asked to confirm that also. Please select allow.
       If your Firewall doesn't prompt you, then you will have to add an exception to allow "java.exe"
       for both in-bound and out-bound traffic on all ports. 
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues for more information.
    4. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    5. To use the Electron client with the Apps/Widgets overlaid on top of the SIM, you 
       must have the SIM running in Windowed mode. Please see the following Wiki info to configure the SIM.
       https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-iRacing-in-Windowed-Mode
    6. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.
